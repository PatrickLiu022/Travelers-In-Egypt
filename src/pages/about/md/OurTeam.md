### Our Team

Undergraduate student interns have played an integral role in the process of transcription, encoding, historical research and data visualization, leading to the establishment of [Newbook Digital Texts](http://www.newbookdigitaltexts.org/), an online publishing house offering a flourishing student internship program in digital humanities. Graduate students have completed capstone projects on various aspects of this project, including web design, metadata, mapping and visualization, and the development of text markup and analysis tools.
